Somehow, it seems the love I knew was always the most destructive kind
不知为何，我经历的爱情总是最具毁灭性的的那种
Yesterday when I was young
昨日当我年少轻狂
The taste of life was sweet
生命的滋味是甜的
As rain upon my tongue
就如舌尖上的雨露
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
我戏弄生命 视其为愚蠢的游戏
The way the evening breeze
就如夜晚的微风
May tease the candle flame
逗弄蜡烛的火苗
